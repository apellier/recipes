	<h2>Description</h2>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
		<li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
		<li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
		<li>1 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
		<li>1 can (400 grams) diced tomatoes</li>
		<li>4-6 large eggs</li>
		<li>Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
		<li>Add the sliced onion and bell peppers to the pan and saut√© for about 5-7 minutes until they become soft and slightly caramelized.</li>
		<li>Stir in the minced garlic, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Cook for an additional minute to allow the spices to release their flavors.</li>
		<li>Pour in the diced tomatoes with their juices and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</li>
		<li>Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the flavors meld together and the sauce thickens slightly. If you prefer a smoother consistency, you can use a spoon to lightly crush the tomatoes while they cook.</li>
		<li>Create small wells in the tomato-pepper mixture with the back of a spoon. Gently crack the eggs into the wells, taking care not to break the yolks. Space the eggs evenly across the pan.</li>
		<li>Cover the pan with a lid and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your desired level of doneness. If you prefer the yolks to be runny, cook for a shorter time.</li>
		<li>Once the eggs are cooked, remove the pan from heat. Sprinkle the chopped parsley or cilantro over the top as a garnish.</li>
	</ol>
