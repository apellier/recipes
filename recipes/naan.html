	<h2>Description</h2>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>500 grams all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
		<li>250 milliliters warm milk</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
		<li>Melted butter for brushing (optional)</li>
		<li>Chopped garlic or cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm milk. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
		<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture, yogurt, and vegetable oil.</li>
		<li>Stir the ingredients together until a sticky dough forms. Then, transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour as needed.</li>
		<li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
		<li>Once the dough has risen, preheat a non-stick pan or a griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
		<li>Divide the dough into small portions, about the size of a golf ball. Take one portion, flatten it with your hands, and then use a rolling pin to roll it into an oval or round shape.</li>
		<li>Carefully place the rolled naan onto the preheated pan or griddle and cook for about 1-2 minutes until bubbles start to form on the surface. Flip it over and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the naan puffs up and develops golden brown spots.</li>
		<li>Remove the cooked naan from the pan and brush it with melted butter, if desired. You can also sprinkle it with chopped garlic or cilantro for added flavor.</li>
	</ol>
