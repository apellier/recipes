	<h2>Description</h2>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<h3>Ravioli Dough</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>2 large eggs</li>
		<li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>0.25 cup water</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Ravioli Filling</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups fresh spinach, chopped</li>
		<li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
		<li>0.5 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>1 egg, beaten</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>Salt and pepper</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Sauce</h3>
	<ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and crack the eggs into it. Beat the eggs gently with a fork, gradually incorporating the flour until a dough forms. If the dough feels dry, add water a tablespoon at a time until it comes together.</li>
		<li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>In the meantime, prepare the filling. In a pan, sauté the minced garlic in olive oil over medium heat until fragrant. Add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
		<li>In a mixing bowl, combine the sautéed spinach, shredded mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, beaten egg, and season with salt and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
		<li>After the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Take one portion and roll it out into a thin sheet using a rolling pin or pasta machine. Dust with flour as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
		<li>Spoon small portions of the filling onto one half of the rolled-out dough, leaving space between each mound of filling. Brush water around the filling to moisten the dough.</li>
		<li>Fold the other half of the dough over the filling and press down around each mound of filling to seal the ravioli. Use a pastry cutter or a sharp knife to cut out individual ravioli squares.</li>
		<li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
		<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ravioli to the boiling water and cook for about 3-4 minutes or until they float to the surface. Remove the cooked ravioli with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
